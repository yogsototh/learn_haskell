In this section, I will explain how to use IO, not how it works.
You'll see how Haskell separates the pure from the impure parts of the program.

Don't stop because you're trying to understand the details of the syntax.
Answers will come in the next section.

What to achieve?

 > Ask a user to enter a list of numbers.
 > Print the sum of the numbers

> toList :: String -> [Integer]
> toList input = read ("[" ++ input ++ "]")
>
> main = do
>   putStrLn "Enter a list of numbers (separated by comma):"
>   input <- getLine
>   print $ sum (toList input)

It should be straightforward to understand the behavior of this program.
Let's analyze the types in more detail.

~~~
putStrLn :: String -> IO ()
getLine  :: IO String
print    :: Show a => a -> IO ()
~~~

Or more interestingly, we note that each expression in the `do` block has a type of `IO a`.

<pre>
main = do
  putStrLn "Enter ... " :: <span class="high">IO ()</span>
  getLine               :: <span class="high">IO String</span>
  print Something       :: <span class="high">IO ()</span>
</pre>

We should also pay attention to the effect of the `<-` symbol.

~~~
do
 x <- something
~~~

If `something :: IO a` then `x :: a`.

Another important note about using `IO`.
All lines in a do block must be of one of the two forms:

~~~
action1             :: IO a
                    -- in this case, generally a = ()
~~~

or

~~~
value <- action2    -- where
                    -- bar z t :: IO b
                    -- value   :: b
~~~

These two kinds of line will correspond to two different ways of sequencing actions.
The meaning of this sentence should be clearer by the end of the next section.
